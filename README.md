# Quantum Task: Teleportation 🌀 
The goal of teleportation is to transfer a quantum bit. Sara and Khalid must use a third party (Telamon) to send them an entangled qubit pair over one classical bit. Sara then performs some operations on their qubit and sends the results to Khalid over a classical communication channel. Khalid then performs some operations on their end to receive Sara’s qubit.

The teleportation protocol can be thought of as a flipped version of the superdense coding protocol, in the sense that Sare and Khalid merely “swap their equipment.”



## Task 1: Building the Teleportation Protocol
In this task, you will work with qubits using Qiskit to create a code with a function that applies the teleportation protocol. This will permit Sara and Khalid to use a third party to send an entangled pair and apply the Quantum Teleportation Protocol to "teleport" Sara's qubit to Khalid.

## Steps:
1. Set up your Python environment with Qiskit and import the required libraries.
2. Use two qubits to create an entangled Bell pair. Qubit A is given to Sara; Qubit B is given to Khalid
3. Apply some operation to specific qubits to perform the Teleportation
4. Display an Output that proves that the performance of the teleportation has happened in your code
